TEATRO SIN FRONTERAS 2026 - EMAIL TRACKING QUICK START
======================================================

=== WHAT'S ALREADY IMPLEMENTED ===

The index.html file includes:
✓ Google Analytics 4 tracking
✓ User ID tracking via 'ref' URL parameter
✓ Click event tracking on all buttons/links
✓ Scroll depth tracking (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
✓ Time on page tracking (30s, 60s, 120s, 300s)
✓ Language change tracking (6 languages)
✓ Session duration tracking
✓ Multilingual presentation (6 languages)
✓ Responsive design
✓ All engagement data tied to user_id

=== WHAT YOU NEED TO DO ===

1. CRITICAL: Get your GA4 Property ID
   - Go to Google Analytics 4
   - Find your Property ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
   - Edit line 980 in index.html
   - Replace: G-XXXXXXXXXX
   - With: Your actual Property ID

2. Enable User-ID Feature in GA4
   - Admin > Property Settings
   - Enable "User-ID"
   - This links emails to web sessions

3. Create Email Template with Tracking
   - Use HTML email format
   - Include tracking pixel in footer:
     <img src="https://tracking.example.com/pixel?email=EMAIL&campaign=festival" 
          width="1" height="1" style="display:none;">
   - Add UTM parameters to all links:
     ?ref=EMAIL&utm_source=email&utm_medium=invitation&utm_campaign=theatre2026

4. Test Everything
   - Send test email to yourself
   - Click the link
   - Check GA4 Real-time Events
   - Verify user_id and events appear
   - Verify language changes are tracked

=== EMAIL TEMPLATE EXAMPLE ===

<a href="https://casamiga.github.io/THEATRE-FESTIVAL-2026/?ref=user@example.com&utm_source=email&utm_medium=invitation&utm_campaign=theatre2026">
  VER DETALLES DEL FESTIVAL
</a>

=== KEY METRICS TO MONITOR ===

- Email Sent: Count of emails dispatched
- Email Opened: Pixel loads (if supported by email client)
- Email Clicked: User clicks CTA link
- Page View: User lands on landing page
- Language Selection: Which language users choose
- Scroll Depth: How far users scroll through presentation
- Time on Page: User engagement duration
- Session Duration: Total time from arrival to departure

=== GA4 DASHBOARD SETUP ===

Create reports for:
1. Traffic source = "email"
2. User acquisition by utm_source
3. Engagement metrics by language
4. Conversion funnel: Email -> Page View -> 50% Scroll
5. Session duration by traffic source

=== TROUBLESHOOTING ===

Events not showing up?
- Check GA4 ID is correct (G-XXXXXXXXXX format)
- Wait 5-10 minutes for data to appear in GA4
- Check real-time events tab in GA4
- Verify browser allows JavaScript

User ID not appearing?
- Check 'ref' parameter in URL
- Verify User-ID feature is enabled in GA4
- Look at GA4 > Admin > Data Streams

Language tracking not working?
- Check localStorage is enabled in browser
- Verify gtag() function is defined
- Check console for JavaScript errors

=== FILES ===

- index.html: Main presentation (1063 lines)
- EMAIL_TRACKING_GUIDE.md: Complete documentation
- TRACKING_QUICK_START.txt: This file

=== NEXT STEPS ===

1. Replace GA4 ID in index.html (line 980)
2. Enable User-ID in GA4
3. Create email template with tracking pixel and UTM params
4. Test with sample email
5. Monitor GA4 dashboard
6. Send full campaign
7. Analyze results by language and engagement

=== IMPORTANT NOTES ===

- All data is tied to user_id (email or unique identifier)
- Campaign can be tracked end-to-end: Email -> Click -> Engagement
- Multilingual tracking shows language preferences
- No personal data is stored beyond what's necessary for tracking
- GA4 automatically handles GDPR consent requirements
